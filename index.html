  <p class="lead">Hi, I'm Aman and I go online by the handle thatvirdiguy. I'm interested in information security and cloud automation, so I generally work in the integration of SecOps and DevOps.</p>
  <p>The blog section of this site is a personal space where I tend to document stuff I'm working on in my homelab and make quick notes I want to remember. These are usually things in the cloud security, vulnerability assessment, and penetration testing world.</p>
